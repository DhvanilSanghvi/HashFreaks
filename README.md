# HashFreaks
Repository for codefundo++ 2019. An application aiming to make the election process faster, secure and reliable based on Azure blockchain services.

## Idea
Our idea is to use Azure blockchain services and workbench to create an application that will simulate an EVM machine. The data collected will then be stored on a permissioned blockchain. The implementation of our app will require setting up of EVM booths where the EVM's will be a permissioned blockchain peer. The final election results could be declared within minutes of the completion of the election. Every EVM machine will be similar to each other and won't be marked according to their geographical location. A separate tab would be set up in the application to select the constituency in which the voter is listed on. This would empower lakhs of citizens whose votes are lost because they couldn't make it to their own constituency.
